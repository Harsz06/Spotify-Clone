# Spotify-Clone
Spotify Clone Project
This project is a Spotify-inspired music player interface, created using HTML and CSS. It mimics the sleek design and functionality of the popular music streaming platform. The clone includes the following features:

A visually appealing home page.
A responsive layout for compatibility with different screen sizes.
Basic navigation and styling that replicates Spotify's modern aesthetic.
This project is a demonstration of my growing skills in web development, focusing on front-end design principles such as layout structure, typography, and responsive design.

Iâ€™m currently exploring more advanced technologies, including JavaScript, React, and APIs, to enhance the functionality and interactivity of similar projects in the future.
